# Inlinotto
Quickly convert inline styles to a style sheet in a few seconds.
## Explanation
Coming from personal experience, it can be a pain to move back and forth files just adding styles to a stylesheet. This tool allows you to paste in your HTML and it will strip the styles and assign a random id to the elements and generate a stylesheet for you. This tool is very basic and is designed just to help with smaller projects.
